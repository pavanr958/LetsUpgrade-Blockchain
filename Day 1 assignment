Blockchain  Essential 
DAY 1 ASSIGNMENT 1:-

1)• What is your understanding of Blockchain?
Ans:- Blockchain is the mixture of distributed database & cryptography technology. It is ledger having transaction records which ensures security, transparency and decentralisation. The blocks are consecutively connected by a link where two ends of the link include the parent hash of previous block and the current hash of respective block. So even a minor change to any data results to change of sequence in every other block in the series.

2)• What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
Ans:- There are 3 core problems:
1). Authenticity
2). Security
3). Verification

3)• What are the few features which blockchain will give u?
Ans:- It consists of the following features:
1). Verifiable
2). Unchanged
3). Tamper-Proof
4). Immutable

4)• What all things does a Block Contain?
Ans:- A block contains the following
1). Block number
2). Transaction records
3). Previous hash key
4). Mining key

5)• How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?
Ans:- Blockchain is based on distributed database, which prevents data loss from any of the systems.If the data in one block changes then it should be changed in other blocks also.
